# WORK IN PROGRESS - THIS IS INCOMPLETE

In the book, movie, Netflix show, and stage musical, *Matilda*, there is a scene where the titular character tips over a cup, using telepathic skills.
This is fairly straightforwards for the first 3, but if you're an Off-Off-*Off*-Broadway (read: high school/community theatre) theater, then this might present a challenge.

String is an obvious option, but an additional dramatic effect can be gained by having the cup move before it tips.
